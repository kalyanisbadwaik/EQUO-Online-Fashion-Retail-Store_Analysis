# EQUO-Online-Fashion-Retail-Store_Analysis

Led a data-driven analysis for an online retail fashion store- EQUO, over a six-month period, utilizing BigQuery for large-scale data processing and Looker Studio for advanced data visualization.
The project involved evaluating key performance metrics, such as return rates, location analytics, marketing effectiveness, product performance, and customer feedback.
Leveraged these tools to uncover the optimal location for a new shop, identify the most effective marketing strategies, and determine the best-selling product.
By analyzing return trends and customer behavior, I provided actionable insights that reduced return rates by 10%, enhanced customer satisfaction, and supported strategic decision-making.
The comprehensive analysis led to improved business strategies and drove significant revenue growth.
